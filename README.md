# Music Generation with LSTM and xLSTM

## Overview

This project investigates the generation of Irish music using deep learning models. By leveraging a large dataset of 216,284 unique Irish songs encoded in ABC notation, we compare the performance of traditional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with the newly developed Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) framework. The goal is to enhance the accuracy and performance of music prediction and generation tasks.

## Collaborators

This project was developed in collaboration with 2 other students at Aarhus University. 

## Course

This project was undertaken as part of the **Deep Learning** course at Aarhus University.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared ABC notation data for model training.
- **Model Implementation:** Developed both LSTM and xLSTM architectures using PyTorch.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimized learning rates and dropout probabilities for best performance.
- **Evaluation:** Compared model accuracy and performance to establish a performance baseline.

## PDF file

If you are more curious, please have a look at the PDF file in the repository where we go into further details about the project. However, there was a maximum of 2 pages, and therefore there are subjects we were not able to cover due to the limited number of pages.

## Limitations
A major limitation in the way we trained the models, as shown in the images below, is that we did not clean the data sufficiently. Many of the songs contain comments, which is evident in the pictures, resulting in a very limited number of songs that actually use the characters.

## Usefulness
In general, the songs generated by the model were acceptable. This is, of course, subjective, but the music did not sound too off-beat or off from what you would intuitively expect as the correct note. However, the model often ended the song earlier than the actual song. The method we used to generate the song below was to provide the first half of the song and then have the model predict the last part of the song.
